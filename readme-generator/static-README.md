# 100-days-of-code

The idea of the project is to commit yourself at least one hour a day to code in any language you want for a hundred days (at least). The regularity is key here, you need to practice a bit everyday, including the weekends.
All the challenges present here are medium/hard level. You can (and you should) participate even if you don't have much experience with coding, it will only take a bit longer.
Most of the challenges can be solved in three hours or less.

## Ranking

If you want to be part of the **challenge ranking**, you need to submit a pull request to be validated by the project contributors. The PR **must** have the label `done` and the title of the PR **must** include the challenge you are submitting (e.g. **day-10**), otherwise no points will not be added to the ranking.
After review, if everything is fine with your PR, the branch will be merged into the `main` and the ranking generator **automated pipeline** will run everyday at 22:00PM (Amsterdam time) or when triggered manually, to update the README file.
